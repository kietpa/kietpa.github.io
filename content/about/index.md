### Hi, I'm Kiet üëã

I'm an aspiring software engineer who works in the back-end. I recently graduated from the *Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology* with a bachelor's degree in *Electrical-Engineering* (EE). However, I've decided to pursue a slightly different career path: **software engineering**.

Personally, working in EE; dealing with PLCs, Motors, electrical diagrams, and other technical work wasn't as enjoyable as programming software. The feeling I get seeing my projects come to life (albeit in a screen) is very enjoyable to me. 

Maybe it's the fact that software documentation is more readily available than in EE. I remember spending a whole week reading the manual book of an Omron synchronous motor, and still not understanding a single thing. Whereas with the GCP or Golang docs, it would take much less time to understand since I can look up what other people have said using Google.

That's why I want to become a software engineer. Hopefully a good one üòÅ
