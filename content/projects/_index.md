## ‚öôÔ∏è DC Motor Speed Control with EKF & PI-PSO

<img src="blokDiagram.png">

A program to estimate and control the speed of a non-linear *DC Motor* without using speed sensors, only electrical sensors. The estimation was done using the ***Extended Kalman Filter*** (EKF) while the motor was controlled by a PI controller, tuned using the ***Particle Swarm Optimization*** (PSO) algorithm. The program was made using MATLAB scripts and Simulink. Created as my **final project** in university.
